# UFC predicitions final project
## Introduction
Adrian Spataru and Bohdan Andrusyak held an online course “Learn Data Science at Home” for beginners in the field of data science. The last part of this 5-week course is to create a project based on public data that uses many of the learned techniques.
I decided to use UFC fight statistics from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/rajeevw/ufcdata

## Objectives
The following questions seem interesting:
1. Is data.csv calculated correctly?
1. Who won the most fights?
1. What is the best age to win fights?
1. Who won the most title fights?
1. Which accuracy can be reached for the prediction of the winner?
