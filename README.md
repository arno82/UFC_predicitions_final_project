# UFC predicitions final project
## Introduction
Adrian Spataru and Bohdan Andrusyak held an online course “Learn Data Science at Home” for beginners in the field of data science. The last part of this 5-week course is to create a project based on public data that uses many of the learned techniques.
I decided to use UFC fight statistics from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/rajeevw/ufcdata
